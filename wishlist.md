# Toggle term
- some cool keybindings to switch between terminal layouts

# Telescope and lsp
- different keybindings for workspace search and local(current file) search
  Idea:
  
  | Local                | workspace                       |
  |----------------------|---------------------------------|
  | fr(Find References)  |  fwr(Find Workspace References) |
  | fd(Find Diagnostics) |  fwd(Find Workspace Diagnostics)|

- add keybinding for :Telescope resume
